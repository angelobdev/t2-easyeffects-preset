# T2 MacBook Pro EasyEffects Preset

This is a preset for the EasyEffects app that improves the quality of the speaker for T2 Linux users.

This has been tested on a MacBook Pro 15,1 on Fedora 39, but it should work in any other pipewire-based platform.

## Installation

2. Copy the [mbp.json](mbp.json) file in the `~/.config/easyeffects/output/` folder

3. Open EasyEffects, go the the `Pipewire` section (on top)

4. Go to `Presets Autoloading`, select the `Apple Audio Device Speakers` and the `mbp` preset and click on the `+` sign

5. Click on the three dots in the top right corner and open the `Preferences` panel

6. Enable the `Launch Service at System Startup` option

7. Enjoy!
