# T2 MacBook Pro EasyEffects Preset

It has been tested on a MacBook Pro 15,1 running Fedora 39 and Arch Linux, but it should be compatible with any other pipewire-based platform.

4. Go to `Presets Autoloading`, select the `Apple Audio Device Speakers` and the `mbp` preset and click on the `+` sign

5. Click on the three dots in the top right corner and open the `Preferences` panel
